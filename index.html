         <h2>MY PAST</h2>
         <p> I am a 22 year old guy born in Jönköping, raised in Lund. Like most others my age, 
             a majority of my life has been spent in school. Here are some of the schools I have attended:
            <ul>
                <li> Fäladsgården, Lund.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2014 - 2018</li>
                <li> Katedralskolan, Lund.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2018 - 2021</li>
                <li> Augustana College, USA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2021 - 2022</li>
                <li> Lunds universitet, Lund.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2022 - Now</li>
            </ul>
             At Lunds universitet I am currently on my fifth semester at Ekonomie kandidatprogrammet. <br> <br>
             Career wise I spent two years in sales between 2017 and 2018. Since 2019 I have spent my 
            evenings and weekends on my own ecommerce projects. In 2020 it resulted in a succesful 
             UF business - breaking the schools previous revenue (and profit) record. 
             Two failed projects later, I took on a roll as performance marketing manager of 
             my brothers men's bracelet brand Alton of Sweden.

         <h2>WHAT I ENJOY</h2>
         <p> In one sentence, I am a sports guy, gamer, and book worm. <br> <br>
            
            My sport of choice is football,  which I have played all my life. The club Torns IF was my 
            home for 15 years and had a big influence on my childhood. Two years ago I hung up the boots 
            after a wonderful year as a student athlete for the Augustana Vikings. Nowdays I play in a 
            seven-a-side league with friends. It's a great time. 
            <br><br>

            A frightening amount of hours have been spent playing video games. I have played a bit of 
            everything: MOBA-, FPS-, sports games and more. In no other area of my life, is my addictive 
            personality more apparent. I absolutely love the feeling of competing with people and finding 
            an edge to win. Card and board games are no exceptions. 
            <br><br>

            In my early years I devoured books. After not really reading for fun as a teen, I am now back to 
            my old ways. I enjoy a bit of everything but looking at my bookshelf, non fiction takes up a
            majority of real estate.

           <h2>MY FUTURE</h2>
           <p>
            In a way, my interests have culminated into what I believe to be my future path as an entreprenuer.
            If you see life as a game, being an entreprenuer is the ultimate game mode. Right now, my efforts 
            outside of school are focused on mastering performance marketing. I view it as becoming the worlds 
            best salesman; amplified through the power of the internet. 
            <br><br>

            After my bachelors in Business and Economics, I will spend full time growing Alton of Sweden.
            In 15 years I hope to have acquired great knowlegde in how to run an e-commerce business.
            With that knowledge I plan on running an investment fund helping small brands become great. 
            <br><br>

            Other goals is to learn Spanish and continue to make great efforts to spend time with friends and 
            family as much as possible.
